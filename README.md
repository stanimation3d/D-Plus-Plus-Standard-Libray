# Standard D++ Libray
Standard D++ Library is a Standard Library written for the D++ programming language developed by Sahne Dünya. Which programming language is D++? D++ (D Plus Plus) is a programming language developed by Sahne Dünya that is based on D but has added more features. The main reason for its creation is to be fully compatible with the D programming language, so that it can benefit from the areas where the D programming language is used and developers can benefit from modern features. Although the D programming language is not very well known, it is actually a C/C++ alternative. The D programming language may be a language with a small community and is not very well known, but when D++ comes out, things can change, we don't know what will happen. However, we need your support.

# Basic Fetures
1. File extension: source file: .d++ (As you know, many of you are expecting the .dpp extension, but since this extension is used elsewhere, we chose the .d++ extension)
2. Underlying programming language: D
3. Memory management: ownership and borrowing
4. Mainly supported programming: Object-oriented (OOP)
5. Control structures: match (Pattern Matching)
